    "Neural networks, especially complex neural networks, are resource-hungry algorithms. When it comes to training neural networks on medium to large datasets, the amount of computation time to adequately train a model can take hours (or even days!) With simple modelling problems, like the ones covered in this module, training a model in the same notebook as an analysis is no problem. However, with more formal applications of neural network and deep learning models, data scientists cannot afford the time or resources to build and train a model each time they analyze data. In these cases, a trained model must be stored and accessed outside of the training environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "With TensorFlow, we have the ability to save and load neural network models at any stage, including partially trained models. When building a TensorFlow model, if we use Keras' ModelCheckpoint method, we can save the model weights after it tests a set number of data points. Then, at any point, we can reload the checkpoint weights and resume model training. Saving checkpoints while training has a number of benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ We can short-circuit our training loop at any time (stop the function by pressing CTRL+C, or by pressing the stop button at the top of the notebook). This can be helpful if the model is showing signs of overfitting.\n",
    "+ The model is protected from computer problems (power failure, computer crash, etc.). Worst-case scenario: We would lose five epochs' worth of optimization.\n",
    "+ We can restore previous model weight coefficients to try and revert overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's practice generating checkpoint files and loading model weights from different epochs. To make things simple, we'll implement checkpoints to our previous deep learning example notebook. To start, we'll open our \"DeepLearning_Tabular\" notebook and rerun all of the code in the notebook for the following steps:\n",

    "+ Import dependencies.\n",

    "+ Split the preprocessed data into features and target arrays.\n",

    "Once we have defined the file structure and filepath, we need to create a callback object for our deep learning model. A callback object is used in the Keras module to define a set of functions that will be applied at specific stages of the training process. There are a number of different callback functions available that can create log files, force training to stop, send training status messages, or in our case save model checkpoints. To create an effective checkpoint callback using the ModelCheckpoint method, we need to provide the following parameters:\n",

    "Checkpoints are a great way to save model weights during training, but they fall short when it comes to sharing a trained model. In data science, trained models are published in scientific papers, deployed in software, open-sourced on GitHub, not to mention passed along to colleagues. In these cases, it is not practical to pass along only model weights, which can cause frustration and confusion. Instead, we can use the Keras Sequential model's save method to export the entire model (weights, structure, and configuration settings) to an Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5Links to an external site.) file. Once saved, anyone can import the exact same trained model to their environment by using the Keras load_model method and use it for analysis.\n",
